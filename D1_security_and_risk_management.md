## CIA Triad

### Confidentiality

Confidentiality - concept of the measures used to ensure the protection of of the secrecy of data, object, or resources.

* Sensitivity - how much harm info can cause if diclosed

* Discretion - the act of decision that can influence or control disclosure in order to minimize harm or damage

* Criticality - the measure on which information is inportant to the mission

* Concealment - act of hiding orpreventing disclosure. (cover, obfuscation, or distraction)

* Secrecy - preventing disclosure

* Privacy - keeping information that is personally identifiable

* Seclusion - storing data in an out of the way location (probably with strict access controls)

* Isolation - keeping data separate from other data


### Integrity

concept of protecting the reliability and correctness of data.

* Preventing unauthorized subjects from making modifications.
* Preventing authorized subjects from making unauthorized modifications (mistakes)
* Maintaining the internal and external consistency of objects so that their data is a reflection of the real world and any relationship is valid, consistent, and verifiable.


### Availability

authorized subjects are granted timely and uninterupted access to objects. Controls that support sufficient bandwidth and timeliness.


* Usability: state of being easy to use or learn or being able  to be understood and controlled by a subject

* Accessibilty: assurance that the wildest range of subjects can interact with resource regardless of their capabilities or limitations

* Timeliness: Being prompt, on time, within a reasonable time frame, or providing low-latency response


### DAD, Overprotection, Authenticity, Non-repudiation, and AAA Services

DAD Triad represents the failures of the CIA Triad

* Disclosure - Inverse of Confidentiality

* Alteration - Inverse of Integrity

* Destruction - Inverse of Availability


Defense in Depth - "layering"  is the use of multiple controls in a series.

Abstraction - used for efficiency. Similar elements are put into groups, classes, or roles are assigned security controls, restriction, or permissions as a collective.


Security Policy:
• Define the scope
• Identify all assets
• Determine level of protection
• Determine personal responsibility
• Develop consequences for noncompliance


Protection Mechanisms
* Defense in Depth
* Abstraction
    Used for efficiency
    Similar Elements are put into groups, classes, or roles.
* Data Hiding

Security Boundaries
* is the line of intersection between any two areas, subnets, or environments having different security requirements
