### DAD, Overprotection, Authenticity, Non-repudiation, and AAA Services

DAD Triad represents the failures of the CIA Triad

* Disclosure - Inverse of Confidentiality

* Alteration - Inverse of Integrity

* Destruction - Inverse of Availability


Defense in Depth - "layering"  is the use of multiple controls in a series.

Abstraction - used for efficiency. Similar elements are put into groups, classes, or roles are assigned security controls, restriction, or permissions as a collective.


Security Policy:
• Define the scope
• Identify all assets
• Determine level of protection
• Determine personal responsibility
• Develop consequences for noncompliance


Protection Mechanisms
* Defense in Depth
* Abstraction
    Used for efficiency
    Similar Elements are put into groups, classes, or roles.
* Data Hiding

Security Boundaries
* is the line of intersection between any two areas, subnets, or environments having different security requirements


Security Governance is the collection of practices related to supporting, evaluating, defining, and directing the security efforts of an organization.
